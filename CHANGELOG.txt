-) Added 'const' keyword to function arguments that do not change value


2018-06-18
-) Updated READMEs
-) Release code on GitHub


2017-04-03
-) New functionality
    *) rolling_product, rolling_central_moment, rolling_sum_stable, rolling_sd, rolling_var
    *) Two-sided rolling time windows are now supported
    *) Certain edge cases that produced errors (e.g. a time window with no observations in it) are now handled using the IEEE 754 constants NAN and INFINITY
    *) Lots of small efficiency improvements
-) Code cleanup
    *) The code is now spread over three different source files instead of just one
    *) Removed the abbreviations in EMA and SMA names. For example, renamed "SMA_lin" to "SMA_linear"
    *) Renamed "SMA_eq" to "rolling_mean"
-) Removed
    *) "sma_eq_stable" (which should have been named "rolling_mean_stable")
    *) the rolling moment operators, because they are trivial modification of "rolling_sum"
    *) "rolling_quantile_eq" (which should have been named "rolling_quantile")
    *) the Makefile, because compiling directly is really easy
    *) error checking via assert()
-) Changed license to GPL-2 | GPL-3


2013-10-13
-) Fixed typo in EMA and EMA_eq pseudo code: times[j] - times[j-1] should be divided by tau (instead of multiplied with)


2012-12-15
-) Fixed bug reported by Jan Sulmont in "rolling_max" and "rolling_min"


2012-04-12
-) Initial release
